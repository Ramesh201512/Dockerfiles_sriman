kubectl get storageclass
kubectl get pv
kubectl get pvc


NOTE: we need to create two 1)ingress resouce  (rules to traffic from external to inside)      
2)ingress controller (it is nothing but pod or nothing but internal load balancer)

ingress: kubernetes ingress is a resource to add rules for routing traffic from external sources
         to the services in the kubernetes cluster
Layer4: network(TCP) L.B routing is based on port
Layer7: Application(HTTP,HTTPS) load balancer.here we can define path based or host based routing rules.
        ex: http://javawebapp.example.com
            http://javawebapp.example.com/java-web-app.


request---->loadbalancer----->ingresscontroller-pod(will use ingress rules)----->services---->pods--->container.
